# Supervised_ML
This project was created to use machine learning to assess credit risk, as in who has potentially risky credit.
This was very interesting and I would love to hone my skills further to create more usable models. At the time of creating this the models I currently have are very basic and are not that credible. I would not recommend them for professional use at this point. Give it a download I am eager for any recommendations at this point I am to inexperienced to make any of my own.
